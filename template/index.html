      <h2>About Rainfall Predictor</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;">Rainfall Predictor is a web app which has 
      a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to 
      predict whether it will rain the next day or not. This model is based on the Rain Prediction
      in Australia dataset. The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com/akshayskumar94/Rainfall_Prediction" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">github repo</a>. More than 80% of Australia has an annual rainfall of less than 
      600 mm which is less among the all continents other than Antartica which recieves less 
      rainfall. A place inland near Lake Eyre would only receive 81 mm of rain annually. The 
      average annual rainfall in the Australian desert is low, ranging from 81 to 250 mm. 
      Thunderstorms are relatively common in the region, with an annual average of 15 to 20 
      thunderstorms. The southern parts of Australia get the usual westerly winds and 
      rain-bearing cold fronts that come when highâ€“pressure systems move towards northern 
      Australia during winter. Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the
      coast are mild or near mild all year round. By analysing such history of weather patterns in
      the region, we can attempt to predict probability of rainfall for a specific location
      based on easily available data such as wind direction, humidity, temperature etc.

      <h2>Dashboard</h2>
      <p>This dashboard is done using a software called PowerBI which is a product of Microsoft.
        Here I have just attached the images of the dashboard because PowerBI needs oraganizational
        account.The usage of dashboards like these is to bring a better understanding about the dataset and also to bring some thoughtful insights.</p>
